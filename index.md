## Research Interests

- Knowledge Representation Learning
- Graph Representation Learning
- Data Mining
- Deep Learning

My current research focuses on practical problems brought about by the era of big data. Knowledge graph, as an important form of the existence of a large number of data, its representation learning can play an important role in quite a number of practical applications, including Question Answering, Intelligent Search, Recommender System, and so on. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful issue and bring well-being to society.
